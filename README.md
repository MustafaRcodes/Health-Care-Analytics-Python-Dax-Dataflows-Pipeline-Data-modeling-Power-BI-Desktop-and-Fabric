Objective:

The objective of this project is to determine how to maximize hospital capacity and allocate resources effectively, which could result in saving lives and optimizing operating expenses.

Insights and Recommendations:

·      The average inpatient stays for 37 hours or 1.5 days. The hospital needs to calculate the number of inpatients arriving daily and multiply it by the average stay of 1.5 days. The recommendation is that the hospital should aim to have 25-30 empty beds available per month and 1 bed available per day.

·      Priority 1, 2, and 3 patients from emergency, inpatient, and urgent care should be prioritized by allocating more doctors and nurses to these divisions. The key recommendation is for the hospital to monitor resources monthly and allocate them accordingly.

·      The days with the highest number of Priority 1 patients are Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday. The recommendation is to reallocate resources from Priority 5 and Priority 6 patients to focus more on Priority 1, 2, and 3 patients during these days.

·      The majority of hospital patients are between the ages of 66 and 100, with the average length of stay ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 days, excluding outliers. There is no positive correlation between age and the length of stay at the hospital.

·      A seasonal increase in patient visits is observed from October to February. The recommendation is for the hospital to focus on recruitment and equipment procurement before the October peak period.

·      The average procedure and medication cost per patient is $3,134. For patients aged 51-100, the minimum cost is $849, and the maximum cost is $7,629. A negative correlation is observed between age and cost for the 19-50 age group, where costs range from $2,428 to $8,802 for younger patients, and from $1,995 to $6,300 for middle-aged patients.

·      In young female patients, the top reason for hospital visits is prenatal care or pregnancy , while for young males, it is health-related procedures. For patients aged 51-65, urgent care is the primary reason for visits, and for patients aged 66-100, critical problems and urgent care are the top reasons. Most common health issue among high groups are heart failure and hyperlipidemia.

·      Native and Black patients spend more on healthcare compared to White and Asian patients. The data suggests that Native and Black patients require more critical care and procedures, while White and Asian patients spend significantly less on healthcare.

·      Out of 27,891 patients, 15,817 (57%) are from Boston. The recommendation is to allocate more ambulances and resources to this region due to the high demand for healthcare services.
